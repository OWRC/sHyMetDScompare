This plot compares the volume of precipitation interpolated by the ORMGP Climate Data Service to the location of a known climate station. Ideally, the cumulative plots should overlie one another. Deviation between these two lines indicates potential bias between interpolation and point observation.

With respect to precipitation, it is important to note that as of 2002, ECCC's CaPA-RDPA and as of 2010 NOAA's SNODAS are employed. Prior to that, ECCC's MSC station data were interpolated from.
